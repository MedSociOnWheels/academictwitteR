## Introduction

The v2 Twitter API allows for greater precision when making queries. A query might just be a single string like "happy new year" if you're interested on how people are celebrating on the night of December 31. Alternatively, the query might involve several additional operators that filter tweets with greater precision to return specific tweet content. 

This vignette guides you through the logics underpinning queries to the Twitter API. For full information on these logics you may additionally wish to consult the Twitter API documentation on how to build a query [here](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tweets/search/integrate/build-a-query).

## Building a query manually

We first load our package into memory with:

```{r setup}
library(academictwitteR)
```

With the `academictwitteR` you have two main options when building a query. The first is to do it "manually" by following the documentation provided by Twitter (linked above) and pasting in the relevant operators to your query.

Here's how you might achieve this, using the `get_all_tweets()` function:

```{r, eval=F}

tweets <-
  get_all_tweets(
    "#BLM OR #BlackLivesMatter",
    "2020-01-01T00:00:00Z",
    "2020-01-05T00:00:00Z",
    bearer_token,
    data_path = "data/"
    bind_tweets = FALSE
  )
  
```

We begin with the same query as used in the introductory vignette, which searches for tweets containing one or both of the specified hashtags relating to the Black Lives Matter movement. We may, however, want to be more precise with our query. Let's say we were only interested in tweets written in English and originating from the US. We would add several operators to our query to filter by these characteristics:

```{r, eval=F}

tweets <-
  get_all_tweets(
    "#BLM OR #BlackLivesMatter place_country:US lang:en",
    "2020-01-01T00:00:00Z",
    "2020-01-05T00:00:00Z",
    bearer_token,
    data_path = "data/",
    bind_tweets = FALSE
  )
  
```

Let's further say that we weren't interested in retweets, and that we were only interested in tweets that contained an image. We would then narrow down our query further:

```{r, eval=F}

tweets <-
  get_all_tweets(
    "#BLM OR #BlackLivesMatter place_country:US lang:en -is:retweet has:images",
    "2020-01-01T00:00:00Z",
    "2020-01-05T00:00:00Z",
    bearer_token,
    data_path = "data/",
    bind_tweets = FALSE
  )
  
```

We might then decide that our geo filter is not accurate enough. We don't just want tweets originating from the US but we want tweets from Seattle in particular. This would mean adding more operators to our query:

```{r, eval=F}

tweets <-
  get_all_tweets(
    "#BLM OR #BlackLivesMatter place_country:US place:seattle lang:en -is:retweet has:images",
    "2020-01-01T00:00:00Z",
    "2020-01-05T00:00:00Z",
    bearer_token,
    data_path = "data/",
    bind_tweets = FALSE
  )
  
```

What if we were unsatisifed with the accuracy of our geo parameters and we wanted to be sure that our tweets were actually coming from a particular place? Let's say we are interested in central Seattle, as shown in the map below.

Twitter also allows us to query tweets originating from within a particular geographical buffer too. Here, we simply specify the longitude and latitude of the southwest and then the northeast corners of this bounding box. Note, this image is taken from a screenshot of the website [http://bboxfinder.com](http://bboxfinder.com). Many such websites exist that allow you to find the bounding box coordinates of a place of interest, including [https://www.openstreetmap.org](https://www.openstreetmap.org) and [https://boundingbox.klokantech.com/](https://boundingbox.klokantech.com/).

We can then input this information with the "bounding_box" operator as below:

```{r, eval=F}

tweets <-
  get_all_tweets(
    "#BLM OR #BlackLivesMatter bounding_box:[-122.375679 47.563554 -122.266159 47.643417] lang:en -is:retweet has:images",
    "2020-01-01T00:00:00Z",
    "2020-01-05T00:00:00Z",
    bearer_token,
    data_path = "data/",
    bind_tweets = FALSE
  )
  
```

## Building a query with `build_query()`

Alternatively, you can use the convenience function `build_query()` included in the `academictwitteR` package. 

The function comes with multiple optional parameters, which can be combined to generate a more precise query. This can then be passed to an object, here called "query," which can then be entered into the `get_all_tweets()` function as our query. 

The below provides an example, and prints the out output of the function. Here, we are building a query for the #BLM hashtag, specifying that we do not want to capture retweets, that we want to tweets to originate from London, that we don't want to capture any promoted tweets, that we want the tweets to contain  URLs, that we want it to contain videos, and that they are written in English. 

```{r}

query <- build_query(query = "#BLM", is_retweet = FALSE, place = "London", remove_promoted = TRUE, has_links = TRUE, has_videos = TRUE, lang = "en")

query
  
```

We can also enter geographical information with the `build_query()` function. Our two options here are the `point_radius` and `bbox` arguments. Both of these take numeric vectors as inputs. The `point_radius` argument requires three pieces of information: the longitude and latitude of a target coordinate, and the buffer size around that coordinate. The `bbox` argument, which stands for "bounding box," requires four pieces of information: the longitude and latitude of the southwest corner of the bounding box and the longitude and latitude of the northeast corner of the bounding box.

To build a query including a filter by point radius, we might use:

```{r}

query <- build_query(query = "#BLM", point_radius = c(-0.131969125179604,51.50847878040284, 25), lang="en")

query
  
```

Additionally, the `build_query()` function includes prompts for entering parameters that require more precise geographical information, like the "bounding_box" or "point_radius" parameters for which we can submit queries to the Twitter API.




```
Which geo buffer type type do you want? 

1: Point radius
2: Bounding box
```
