\description{
This function loops through specified strings or hashtags and collects tweets containing the strings or hashtags between specified date ranges that also contain Tweet-specific geolocation data provided by the Twitter user. This can be either a location in the form of a Twitter place, with the corresponding display name, geo polygon, and other fields, or in rare cases, a geo lat-long coordinate. Note: Operators matching on place (Tweet geo) will only include matches from original tweets. Tweet-level data is stored in a data/ path as a series of JSONs beginning "data_"; User-level data is stored as a series of JSONs beginning "users_". If a filename is supplied, this function will save the result as a RDS file, otherwise, it will return the results as a dataframe.
